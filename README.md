Manual writing of data serialization and deserialization code in different programming languages
is a time-consuming and error-prone 
especially intended for heterogeneous devices. The most efficient solution is to create a DSL ‚Äì that first formally
describes the protocol,
and then creates a utility that generates the source code based on this description for various target platforms, in the
required programming languages.


Some examples of this approach are available in the links listed below:  
[Protocol Buffers ](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)  
[Cap‚Äôn Proto ](https://capnproto.org/language.html)  
[FlatBuffers ](http://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html)  
[ZCM ](https://github.com/ZeroCM/zcm/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md)  
[MAVLink ](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink)  
[Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/docs/idl)

Having studied these, and many others, I decided to build my system that will implement and complement the merits,
eliminating the discovered shortcomings.
I named this project AdHoc protocol.

The **AdHoc** is a multilingual **C#, Java, Typescript ( upcoming C++, Rust, GO)** generator of code to handle its
binary protocol.
The AdHoc server generates code according to your protocol description file.
You must implement the received packet handlers and packet-producing logic, fill packs with data and send them
to the recipient.

**AdHoc** generator features:

- bitfields,
- ordinary and nullable primitive datatypes
- strings, Maps, Set datatypes
- multidimensional fields with predefined and variable dimensions
- nested packs, enums
- ordinary and flags-like enums
- fields with enum and other pack datatypes
- host and packet level constants
- pack's fields inheritance
- host's communication interfaces inheritance
- importing packs and communication interfaces from other AdHoc protocol descriptions
- [Base 128 Varint](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding) compression.
- generate ready-to-use network infrastructure

Right now, the code generator is built as [**SaaS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service). To
generate (and test) the source code, it is necessary to:

- install **.NET**.
- install any **C#** IDE (**[Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) / [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)** )
- download source code of [AdHo—Å protocol metadata attributes](https://github.com/cheblin/AdHoc-protocol/tree/master/org/unirail/AdHoc).
  Or use embedded into AdHocAgent binary.  
  **AdHoc protocol** description projects need a reference to a metafile with attributes
- To upload your protocol description file to the server and receive the result, you will need the
  **[AdHocAgent](https://github.com/cheblin/AdHocAgent)** utility. Please download
  the [prebuilt version](https://github.com/cheblin/AdHocAgent/tree/master/bin)  or download the source.

# AdHocAgent utility

AdHocAgent utility accepts the following command line input:

The first argument is the path to the task file, and  if provided path ends with:
  - `.cs`  - is means to upload the provided protocol description file to the server to generate source code
  - `.cs!` - to upload the provided protocol description file to generate source code and test it   
  
>The rest arguments are:
> - paths to source `.cs` and  project `.csproj` files imported and used in the root protocol description file
> - path to a temporary folder to store files received from the server.
> - path to a binary, that executes after deployment (‚ö†Ô∏è mentioned temporary folder - is the working dir, for this executable).
>
> 
>In this case only ‚ö†Ô∏è, additionally, the utility needs a received-source-code deployment instruction file.  
>The name of this file has to start with the protocol description file name plus `Deployment.md` at the end - `MyProtocol_file_nameDeployment.md`  
>
>AdHocAgent utility search this file in
>- description file folder and then
>- in `working directory`  
>
>If cannot find, extract this file template in description file folder. Content of this file must be updated with correct deployment instructions

Else if the first argument path ends with:
  - `.cs?` - this instruct utility to show graphically the information of the provided protocol description file in the viewer
  - `.proto` - is means provided `.proto` file is in [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) format and will send to the server to convert it into Adhoc protocol description format
if one of the argument is a path to a folder it's used as the intermediate result output folder. if it not provided - the current working directory is used.

‚ö†Ô∏èBesides command-line arguments, the AdHocAgent utility needs:
- `AdHocAgent.toml` - the file that contains
  - url to the server   
    and, paths to local:
  - IDE,
  - [7zip compression](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) utility(used for best compression)

AdHocAgent utility search `AdHocAgent.toml` file next to self.
If the file does not exist, the utility generates this file template, so just needed to update the information in this file according to your configuration.

# Overview

The minimal protocol description file may look like this:

```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta; //        importing AdHoc protocol attributes. Required!

namespace com.my.company // You company namespace. Required!
{
 	public interface MyProject { // MyProject  ddeclare AdHoc protocol description project 

        ///<see cref = 'InTS'/>
        struct Server : Host // generate code for this host in TypeScript
        {
            public interface ToClient
            {
                class PacketToClient { } // empty packet to send to client
            }
        }

        ///<see cref = 'InJAVA'/> 
        struct Client : Host // generate code for this host in JAVA
        {
            public interface ToServer
            {
                class PacketToServer { } // empty packet to send to server
            }
        }

        interface Channel : Communication_Channel_Of<Client.ToServer, Server.ToClient> { } //communication channel
    }
}
```
if pass the path to this file, with `?` question char at the end to AdHocAgent utility `\AdHocAgent.exe /dir/minimal_descr_file.cs?` . It will show the following scheme

to upload file and get source code just pass the path to AdHocAgent utility `AdHocAgent.exe /dir/minimal_descr_file.cs`. this will require a deploy instructions file `minimal_descr_fileDeployment.md`


# Protocol description file format

>### Naming entities in your project have to obey rules.
>
>- Name cannot start/end with `_` (underscore).
>- Name cannot match to keywords of a programming languages generator supported. **AdHocAgent** is checking and warning used names before uploading.
>
>- the generator is naming entities as close to the original as possible
   >  generated collections are always public and accessible but if its identifier starts with `_` (underscore) it means that its value is stored in an internal format
>- for visual separation and better IDE IntelliSense,  methods generated for serializer internal needs start with the 'Àâ' Unicode symbol




## Project

As [`DSL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language), to describe **AdHoc protocol** C# language is used.
In fact, the protocol description file is a plain C# source code file in a .Net project.
To start, just create **C#** project and add a reference to [AdHoc protocol metadata attributes.](https://github.com/cheblin/AdHoc-protocol/tree/master/src/org/unirail/AdHoc),
create a new C# source file. The protocol description is declared by C# `interface` enclosed in your company's namespace.

```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta;//        importing AdHoc protocol attributes. Required!

namespace com.my.company// You company namespace. Required!
{
    public interface MyProject { // MyProject  ddeclare AdHoc protocol description project 
        
    } 
}
```

Besides describing the data format (packs, fields) **AdHoc protocol** provides facilities to describe full network topology: hosts, channels, and their relationships.

Lets take a look at following protocol description file example

```csharp

namespace com.my.company
{
	public interface MyProject { 
        ///<see cref = 'InJAVA'/>
        struct Server: Host{
            public interface SendToTrialClient {
                class ServerPack{} // << packets that Server can create and send throught this port
            }

            public interface SendToClient{
                class Login{}
                class PackB{}
            }
        }
        
        ///<see cref = 'InTS'/>
        struct FullFeaturedClient: Host {
            public interface ToServer {
                class FullFeaturedClientPack{} // <<  packets that FullFeaturedClient can create and send throught this port
            }    
        }

        ///<see cref = 'InCS'/>
        struct TrialClient: Host {
            public interface ToServer {
                class TrialClientPack{}
            }    
        }

        ///<see cref = 'InTS'/>
        struct FreeClient: Host {
            public interface ToServer{
 		    
            }    
        }

        interface TrialCommunicationChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToTrialClient, TrialClient.ToServer> { }
        interface CommunicationChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToClient, FullFeaturedClient.ToServer> { }
        interface TheChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToClient, FreeClient.ToServer> { }
    } 
}
```

## Hosts

A `struct` C# construction, inside a project `interface` scope, declare a host ( node/device/unit ) that participates in information exchange.  
Host should implements org.unirail.Meta.Host marker interface.
By means of C# code documentation XML tags [<see cref="member">](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags#cref-attribute)
of the host declaration it's possible to declare source code generating languages and options.
Built-in marker interfaces `InCS`, `InJAVA`, `InTS` etc. let's declare the language configuration scope.

Items(packs or fields) mentioned in the rolling scope are getting the scope configuration.
The latest language configuration scope becomes the default for the rest of the items in the host.

The following language configuration for `Server` host in this file:
```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta;

namespace com.my.company// You company namespace. Required!
{
    public interface MyProject { 
        /** 
        <see cref = 'InCS'/>+-
        <see cref = 'InJAVA'/>++
            <see cref = 'ToAgent.Result'/> 
            <see cref = 'Agent.ToServer.Proto'/>
            <see cref = 'Agent.ToServer.Login'/>  
        <see cref = 'InJAVA'/>--
        */
        struct Server: Host {
		
	    }
    } 
}
```
AdHocAgent utility could be read the in this way..

</details>


## Ports

Each host has ports. They are declared with C# `interface` construction.

```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta;

namespace org.unirail
{
    public interface AdhocProtocol : _<AdhocProtocol.Agent.Project.Host.Port.Pack.Field.DataType>//propagate DataType constants set to all hosts
    {
        /** 
        <see cref = 'InJAVA'/>
        <see cref = 'ToAgent.Result'/> 
        <see cref = 'Agent.ToServer.Proto'/>
        <see cref = 'Agent.ToServer.Login'/>  
        <see cref = 'InJAVA'/>--
        */
        struct Server : Host
        {
            /**
            * public port ToAgent
            */
            public interface ToAgent : _<Upload> // Server's port
            {
             
            }
        }
    }
}
```


The host's ports are can be joined to each other with communication channels.
Packs, added to or declared inside of the host's port, the host can **create and send** to another host.
A pack or packs declared in a port can be added to other by C# inheritance construction

```csharp
            ///<see cref="Full.Path.To.ThePack"/>           <<< add single pack `ThePack` as is
            ///<see cref="Full.Path.To.TheOtherPort"/>      <<< add all packs from `Full.Path.To.TheOtherPort` port as is
            ///<see cref="Full.Path.To.SkipPack"/>-         <<< delete single `SkipPack` pack
            interface SomePort: _<Full.Path.To.SomePack>,   //<<< add single pack `SomePack` by inheritance (user _<> interface wrapper from org.unirail.Meta)
                                Full.Path.To.TheOtherPort   //<<< add all packs from `Full.Path.To.TheOtherPort` port as is
            {
                class Login{}
                class PackB{}
            }
```

## Channels

To join host's ports, **AdHoc protocol** use channels entities.  
Channels declare by means of `interface` C# construction, and like hosts, are located directly inside the project scope.
Channel's `interface` "extends" `org.unirail.Meta.Communication_Channel_Of`  interface and its params list  enumerates two joined ports.

```csharp
        interface TrialCommunicationChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToTrialClient, TrialClient.ToServer> { }
        interface CommunicationChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToClient, FullFeaturedClient.ToServer> { }
        interface TheChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToClient, FreeClient.ToServer> { }
```


## Packs

Packs are, the minimal **transmittable** information unit, declared by `class` C# construction.
Pack's declarations can be nested and may be declared anywhere inside a host scope.
Pack's none constant fields - are a list of information this pack transmits. Constant fields produce pack scope constants.
A packet can be empty(without any fields). In this case, the carried information is the fact, of packet transmission.

It is possible to add/'inherit' **all fields** from other packs.
With comment `<see cref="Full.Path.To.SourcePack"/>` on destination packet or with C# "inheritance" from other packet wrapped into `_<>` interface wrapper

Particular fields can be inherited/embedded from another packet with `<see cref="Full.Path.To.OtherPack.Field"/>` comment on destination packet

Adding fields cannot override existing (with same name)

`<see cref="Full.Path.To.OtherPack.Field"/>-` or `<see cref="Full.Path.To.Source.Pack"/>-` comments let delete individual or all imported fields respectively

When process this description file, generator embed in the source the packets assigned id information.

## Empty packs

Empty packets have no any fields. Implemented as singleton. Used as most efficient way to signal about something.


## Value pack

Packages that information is fit into 8 bytes are special - `Value` packs.
This packets does not allocate on the heap, its data is store in primitive types.
Code generator provides methods to pack and unpack pack's fields data.

Packs with one primitive type field are `Value` by default.

## Enums and constants

If you need to propagate on hosts some constants, and they have the same integral type: use enums

`[Flags]` attributes Indicates that an [enumeration can be treated as a bit field; that is, a set of flags.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.flagsattribute)

None-initialized enum fields are automatically assigned integer values. If enum has `[Flags]` attribute, generated value,
respectively, is **bit flags** like.


If your constants have non primitive datatype, use static/const field of:
-  the pack which they logically related.
-  `constants set` declared with struct C# construction.

enums and  `constants set` are copy on every host and never transfer.

Value of constants declared with `static` fields may be assigned  a number or result of some static expression.
You can use any available C# functions. Values are calculated at generate time.

Constants declared with `const` fields can be used as `attributes parameters`. This is valuable, but it's value should be the result
of compile-time expression. Standard static C# functions to calculate cannot be used.
To overcomes this limitation, AdHoc protocol description syntax use `///<see cref="Pack.static_field_with_real_value"/>` construction.
At code generation time system "copy" value and type from `static` based constant  to `const` based constant.

The root description file's constants are propagating to all hosts.


## Importing other descriptions

C# `using` statement in the description file header, let use entities declared in other protocol description files.

```csharp
using com.company.ProtocolProject;
using com.other_company.OtherProtocolProject;
```

Imported, none-root file's constants are propagating only if explicitly mentioned in  C# inheritance construction of the root project.
Inheritance from other projects - propagate all **constants** they have.
To propagate individual  items  - inherit from other projects particular `enum`/`constants set`.

```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta;

namespace com.my.company
{
    public interface MyProject : Project_const_packs, Particular_const_pack {
        
    } 
}
```

This propagate all **constants** from `Project_const_packs` and `Particular_const_pack` to all hosts in `MyProject` project.

You can wrap `constants sets` to use them in place where C# only interface allowed. The real AdhocProtocol description file example
```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta;

namespace org.unirail
{
    public interface AdhocProtocol : _<AdhocProtocol.Agent.Project.Host.Port.Pack.Field.DataType>//propagate DataType constants set to all hosts
    {
    }
}
```

# Fields

## `Optional` and `required` fields

A pack's field can be `optional` or `required`.

* `required` fields are always allocated and transmitted, even if was not touched and filled with data.
* `optional` fields, in turns, if was not touched, allocates just a few bits


According to AdHoc protocol description rule, primitive data type ended with `?` (`int?`, `byte?`...), and non-primitive data types (`string`, `array`...) are `optional`.
```csharp
class Packet
{
    string user; //non-primitive data types are always optional
    uint? optional_field; //optional primitive field
}     
```


## Numeric fields

All range of C# numeric primitive types are available

| Type   | Range                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| sbyte  | \-128 to 127                                             |
| byte   | 0 to 255                                                 |
| short  | \-32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| ushort | 0 to 65,535                                              |
| int    | \-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| uint   | 0 to 4,294,967,295                                       |
| long   | \-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| ulong  | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615                          |
| float  | ¬±1.5 x 10‚àí45 to ¬±3.4 x 1038                              |
| double | ¬±5.0 √ó 10‚àí324 to ¬±1.7 √ó 10308                            |

As a protocol creator, you know your data in advance, and better, than any code generator. **AdHoc** description provides attributes
that let you share your knowledge with the generator and help generate optimal code.

f your field's data is fits in a range, express this with `MinMax` attribute. Code generator will try to find the best datatype and
generate range bounds information to control passing values.

If value **range** less then 127, code generator will store the value in internal bits storage

```csharp
     [MinMax(1, 8)] int car_doors;     
```

for `car_doors` field code generator could allocate 3 bits in the bits storage

If some field value in, range `200_005` to `200_078`,

```csharp
     [MinMax(200_005, 200_078)] int field;     
```
code generator generate code, that store field, in the bits storage and provide getter/setter to add/subtract `200 005` constant.

## Varint

If the numeric field has random values, uniformly distributed in full it's numeric type range, as noise.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29354319/70127303-bdf40900-16b5-11ea-94c9-c0dcd045500f.png)

Any compression of this kind of data type is wasting of computational resources.  
But, if numeric fields have some dispersion/gradient pattern in its value changing...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29354319/70128574-0a404880-16b8-11ea-8a4d-efa8a7358dc1.png)

It is possible to leverage this knowledge to minimize the amount of data transmission.  
In this case code generator can use [Base 128 Varint](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding)
compression
[algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity), on single fields and `Group Varint Encoding` on
array or list
which allows good and with small resource load, reduces the sending data amount.
This is achieved by skipping transmission of the higher bytes if they are zeros, and then restore them on the receiving.

This graph shows the dependence of sending bytes on transferred value.

It is becoming clear that `Varint Encoding`, for smaller value produce less bytes to transmit.

Let highlight three basic types of numeric value changing patterns.

```csharp
    [A]          uint?  field1;  //optional field, the data is compressable, the field can store values in the range from 0 to uint.MaxValue. 
    [MinMax(-1128, 873)]    byte  field2;   //required field, (without compression), the field accept values in range -1128 to -873                                                          
    [X]          short? field3;   //optional field takes values in the range  from -32 768 to 32 767. will be compressed with ZigZag algorithm.                                       
    [A(1000)]     short field4;   //required field takes a value between ‚Äì 1 000 to 65 535 will be compressed on sending.                                                           
    [V]          short? field5;   //optional field takes a value between  -65 535  to 0  will be compressed on sending.                                                                 
    [MinMax(-11 , 75)] short field6;   //required field with uniformly distributed values in the specified range.     
                                                                                
```


## String fields

Strings in **AdHoc protocol** on all languages are encoded in UTF-8 byte array. All string fields are `optional`

```csharp
string  string_field;
```

## Multidimensional fields

Field can hold a multidimensional array of primitives, strings, maps, sets and packs.
Dimensions can be constant and variable length.

`[Dims]` attribute is used to declare multidimensional field: `Dims(N, -N, N)]`

| N  |N is length of constant dimension         |
|----| :-------------------------------------------|
| -N | N is maximum length of variable dimension  |

## Multidimensional array of arrays

Multidimensional array also can hold other arrays. In this case the last dimension(argument) of `Dims` attribute denote contained array's parameter.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>~N</td>
      <td>All contained arrays have the same variable length, N is it maximum, Exact length is determined at field creation
and cannot be changed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>~~N</td>
      <td>Each contained array has its own length, N is a maximum length. Can be changed individually </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+N</td>
      <td>All arrays, if created, are have the same constant length - N.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
The variable dimensions length are set at field initialization.

```cs
        class Pack {
            [Dims(2 , 3 , 4)] short field1; // multidimensional field of primitive with constant dimensions 

            [Dims(2, -3, -4)] Point field2; //field with multidimensional array of  Ponts. dimension 1 can be in rande 1..3. dimension 2 - in range 1..4 
            
            [Dims(2, -3, +4)] Pack array_field; //field with multidimensional array of constant length 4, arrays of Packs 
            
            [Dims(~17)] Pack var_len_array; //field with var length array of Packs, with max length 17 

            [Dims(2, -3, ~~4)] string array_field1; //multidimensional array of arays of strings. each array has its own length
        }
```
## Fields with binary array datatype

With special attribute `org.unirail.Binary` possible to declare a field with binary data type. Content of this type transfer directly.
This field type implementation depends on target platform. On JAVA it is signed `byte` on C# unsigned 'byte'


## Fields with Map/Set datatype

description is simple and straightforward

```csharp
            Set<uint>                 uint_set;
            Set<float?>               uint_set;
            Set<City>                 set_of_City_types;
            [MinMax(4, 45)] Set<uint> set_with_MinMax_attributes;

            Map<string, byte?>                            string_2_byte;
            [V]                        Map<uint?, ulong?> only_key_attribute_map;
            [MapValueParams, Dims(-5)] Map<uint, uint>    only_value_attribute_map;
            [V, MapValueParams, V]     Map<uint?, ulong?> map_with_key_value_attibutes;
```
`MapValueParams` attribute is `Key`-`Value` attributes delimiter. Attributes after this delimiter apply to `value` type.


## Fields with other pack/enum as datatype

Enums and pack can be a field's data type.

Packs through their fields data type can be nested and self-referenced.
Empty packs or enums with less then two fields cannot be used as field datatype. Use boolean type instead of
