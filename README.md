Writing data serialization and deserialization code manually in different programming languages
can be very time-consuming and prone to errors, 
especially when working with heterogeneous devices. A more efficient solution is to use a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that formally
describes the protocol
and then generates source code based on this description for various target platforms and programming languages.
required programming languages.


This approach can be seen in Protocol Buffers, Cap'n Proto and others which are available at the links provided.

I have studied several approaches to handling binary protocols and decided to create my own system, 
called AdHoc protocol,to address the weaknesses I found in these approaches.


AdHoc is a code generator that supports multiple programming languages, including C#, Java, and Typescript, with 
plans to add support for C++, Rust, and GO in the future.
The AdHoc server generates code based on a protocol description file,
You must implement the received packet handlers and packet-producing logic, fill packs with data and send them
to the recipient.

**AdHoc** generator features:

- bitfields,
- ordinary and nullable primitive datatypes
- strings, Maps, Set datatypes
- multidimensional fields with predefined and variable dimensions
- nested packs, enums
- ordinary and flags-like enums
- fields with enum and other pack datatypes
- host and packet level constants
- pack's fields inheritance
- host's communication interfaces inheritance
- importing packs and communication interfaces from other AdHoc protocol descriptions
- [Base 128 Varint](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding) compression.
- generate ready-to-use network infrastructure

The code generator is currently available as a SaaS (Software as a Service)[**SaaS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service). 
To use it, you will need to:

- install **.NET**.
- install a **C#** IDE such as (**[Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) / [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)** )
- download the source code of the [AdHo—Å protocol metadata attributes](https://github.com/cheblin/AdHoc-protocol/tree/master/org/unirail/AdHoc).
 - or use the version embedded in the AdHocAgent binary.  
 Add a reference to the metafile with attributes in your **AdHoc protocol** description project.
- Use the **[AdHocAgent](https://github.com/cheblin/AdHocAgent)** utility to upload your protocol description file to the server and receive the generated code. You can either download a [prebuilt version](https://github.com/cheblin/AdHocAgent/tree/master/bin)  or download the source.

# AdHocAgent utility

The AdHocAgent utility is a command-line tool that helps to upload your project and download, deploy the generated result.

It processes the following input:

The first argument is the path to the task file, which may include a parameter at the end, to specify the task type:
  - `.cs`  - upload the protocol description file to the server to generate the source code
  - `.cs!` - upload the protocol description file to generate the source code and test the source code  
  
>The remaining arguments are:
> - paths to source files `.cs` and/or `.csproj` project file that used in the mentioned protocol description file
> - The path to a temporary folder to store files received from the server.
> - a path to a binary file, that will be executed after deployment (‚ö†Ô∏è the temporary folder will be the working directory for this executable file).
>
> 
>In this case ‚ö†Ô∏è, the utility will also need an instruction file for deploying the source code received from the server.  
>The file should be named with the protocol description file name followed by  `Deployment.md` e.g. - `MyProtocol_file_nameDeployment.md`  
>
>AdHocAgent utility will search for this file in the following locations:
>- The description file folder
>- The `Working directory`  
>
>If the utility cannot find the file in these locations, it will extract a template of the file in the description file folder, which you can then edit with the correct deployment instructions.

Otherwise if the first argument path ends with the parameters:
  - `.cs?` - this parameter will instruct utility to show the structure of the provided protocol description file in the browser based viewer.
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29354319/232010215-ea6f4b1e-2251-4c3a-956d-017d222ab1e3.png) 
  - `.proto` - it means the provided `.proto` file is in [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) format. The utility will send it to the server to convert into Adhoc protocol description format.
If there is a path to a folder among the arguments the utility will use this folder as the intermediate result output folder. Otherwise -  the utility will use the current working directory.
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29354319/232012276-03d497a7-b80c-4315-9547-ad8dd120f077.png)

‚ö†Ô∏èIn addition to the command-line arguments, the AdHocAgent utility needs:
- An `AdHocAgent.toml` - the file that contains
  - The URL of the code-generating server.   
  - And paths to the local IDE
  - [7zip compression](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) utility(used for best compression)

AdHocAgent utility will search for the `AdHocAgent.toml` file next to itself.
If it cannot find the file in this location, it will generate a template that you can update with your configuration information. Thus it is only necessary to update the information in this file according to your configuration.

# Overview

The minimal protocol description file may look like this:

```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta; //        importing AdHoc protocol attributes. Required!

namespace com.my.company // You company namespace. Required!
{
 	public interface MyProject { // MyProject  ddeclare AdHoc protocol description project 

        ///<see cref = 'InTS'/>
        struct Server : Host // generate code for this host in TypeScript
        {
            public interface ToClient
            {
                class PacketToClient { } // empty packet to send to client
            }
        }

        ///<see cref = 'InJAVA'/> 
        struct Client : Host // generate code for this host in JAVA
        {
            public interface ToServer
            {
                class PacketToServer { } // empty packet to send to server
            }
        }

        interface Channel : Communication_Channel_Of<Client.ToServer, Server.ToClient> { } //communication channel
    }
}
```
If you want to view the structure of a protocol description file, you can use the AdHocAgent utility with the path to the file followed by a question mark e.g. `\AdHocAgent.exe /dir/minimal_descr_file.cs?` . The utility will display the following scheme

</details>
To upload a file and generate the source code, you can simply pass the path to the AdHocAgent utility `AdHocAgent.exe /dir/minimal_descr_file.cs`. This will require a deployment instructions file `minimal_descr_fileDeployment.md`


# Protocol description file format

>### The protocol description file follows a specific naming convention:
>
>- Names should not start or end with an underscore `_`.
>- Names should not match any keywords defined by the programming languages that the code generator supports. **AdHocAgent** will check for and warn about such conflicts before uploading.
>
>- The generator will suggest names that are as close to the original as possible.  
   >  Generated suggestions are always public and accessible.  But, if the identifier starts with an underscore `_`, it means that the value is stored in an internal format
>- for visual separation and better IntelliSense support in IDEs, methods generated for serializer internal needs will start with the 'Àâ' Unicode symbol




## Project

We choose the C# language as [`DSL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) to describe **AdHoc protocol**.
Generally, the protocol description file is a plain C# source code in a .Net project.
To create a protocol description file, you can start by creating a **C#** project and adding a reference to the [AdHoc protocol metadata attributes.](https://github.com/cheblin/AdHoc-protocol/tree/master/src/org/unirail/AdHoc),
Then, create a new C# source file and declare the protocol description using C# `interface` enclosed in your company's namespace.

```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta;//        importing AdHoc protocol attributes. Required!

namespace com.my.company// You company namespace. Required!
{
    public interface MyProject { // MyProject  ddeclare AdHoc protocol description project 
        
    } 
}
```

The **AdHoc protocol** not only defines the data format, including packs and fields, but it also includes features for describing the full network topology. This includes details on hosts, channels, and the relationships between them. 

For example, consider the following protocol description file:

```csharp

namespace com.my.company
{
	public interface MyProject { 
        ///<see cref = 'InJAVA'/>
        struct Server: Host{
            public interface SendToTrialClient {
                class ServerPack{} // << packets that Server can create and send throught this port
            }

            public interface SendToClient{
                class Login{}
                class PackB{}
            }
        }
        
        ///<see cref = 'InTS'/>
        struct FullFeaturedClient: Host {
            public interface ToServer {
                class FullFeaturedClientPack{} // <<  packets that FullFeaturedClient can create and send throught this port
            }    
        }

        ///<see cref = 'InCS'/>
        struct TrialClient: Host {
            public interface ToServer {
                class TrialClientPack{}
            }    
        }

        ///<see cref = 'InTS'/>
        struct FreeClient: Host {
            public interface ToServer{
 		    
            }    
        }

        interface TrialCommunicationChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToTrialClient, TrialClient.ToServer> { }
        interface CommunicationChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToClient, FullFeaturedClient.ToServer> { }
        interface TheChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToClient, FreeClient.ToServer> { }
    } 
}
```

## Hosts

In the AdHoc protocol, hosts are represented as C# `struct` within a project `interface` scope. These hosts participate in the exchange of information and must implement the org.unirail.Meta.Host marker interface.   
Host should implements 
Through XML tags  [<see cref="member">](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags#cref-attribute)
in the host declaration's code documentation, it is possible to specify the language in which the host's source code will be generated, as well as any relevant options.
The built-in marker interfaces `InCS`, `InJAVA`, `InTS` etc. allow for the declaration of language configuration scopes.

Items (such as packs or fields) mentioned within the rolling scope will be given the configuration of that scope.
The most recent language configuration scope becomes the default for the rest of the items within the host.

In the following example, the language configuration for the 'Server' host in this file is:
```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta;

namespace com.my.company// You company namespace. Required!
{
    public interface MyProject { 
        /** 
        <see cref = 'InCS'/>+-
        <see cref = 'InJAVA'/>++
            <see cref = 'ToAgent.Result'/> 
            <see cref = 'Agent.ToServer.Proto'/>
            <see cref = 'Agent.ToServer.Login'/>  
        <see cref = 'InJAVA'/>--
        */
        struct Server: Host {
		
	    }
    } 
}
```
AdHocAgent utility could be read in this manner..

</details>


## Ports

Each host has ports. They are declared with C# `interface` construction.

```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta;

namespace org.unirail
{
    public interface AdhocProtocol : _<AdhocProtocol.Agent.Project.Host.Port.Pack.Field.DataType>//propagate DataType constants set to all hosts
    {
        /** 
        <see cref = 'InJAVA'/>
        <see cref = 'ToAgent.Result'/> 
        <see cref = 'Agent.ToServer.Proto'/>
        <see cref = 'Agent.ToServer.Login'/>  
        <see cref = 'InJAVA'/>--
        */
        struct Server : Host
        {
            /**
            * public port ToAgent
            */
            public interface ToAgent : _<Upload> // Server's port
            {
             
            }
        }
    }
}
```


Hosts can connect to each other through communication channels, known as ports. 
Packs that are added to or declared within a host's port can be **create and send** to another host by the host.
A pack or packs declared in a port can also be added to other ports through C# inheritance.

```csharp
            ///<see cref="Full.Path.To.ThePack"/>           <<< add single pack `ThePack` as is
            ///<see cref="Full.Path.To.TheOtherPort"/>      <<< add all packs from `Full.Path.To.TheOtherPort` port as is
            ///<see cref="Full.Path.To.SkipPack"/>-         <<< delete single `SkipPack` pack
            interface SomePort: _<Full.Path.To.SomePack>,   //<<< add single pack `SomePack` by inheritance (user _<> interface wrapper from org.unirail.Meta)
                                Full.Path.To.TheOtherPort   //<<< add all packs from `Full.Path.To.TheOtherPort` port as is
            {
                class Login{}
                class PackB{}
            }
```

## Channels

The **AdHoc protocol** uses channels to connect the ports of hosts.  
Channels are declared using a C# `interface` and, like hosts, are located directly within the project scope.
The channel's `interface` "extends" the `org.unirail.Meta.Communication_Channel_Of`  interface and its parameter list soecifies the two ports being connected.
For example:
```csharp
        interface TrialCommunicationChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToTrialClient, TrialClient.ToServer> { }
        interface CommunicationChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToClient, FullFeaturedClient.ToServer> { }
        interface TheChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToClient, FreeClient.ToServer> { }
```


## Packs

Packs are the smallest unit of transmittable information, declared using a C# `class` construction.
Pack declarations can be nested and can be placed anywhere within a host's scope. 
The pack's non-constant fields represent the information that the pack transmits. Constant fields create constants within the pack's scope.
A pack can be empty, in which case the transmitted information is simply the fact of the packet's transmission.

It is possible to add/'inherit' **all fields** from other packs through the use of the <see cref='Full.Path.To.SourcePack'/> comment
on the destination pack or through C# "inheritance" from the other pack wrapped in the `_<>` interface wrapper.

Individual fields can also be inherited or embedded from another pack using the `<see cref="Full.Path.To.OtherPack.Field"/>` comment on the destination pack.

Fields cannot be overridden if they have the same name as an existing field. 

The `<see cref="Full.Path.To.OtherPack.Field"/>-` or `<see cref="Full.Path.To.Source.Pack"/>-` comments can be used to delete individual or all imported fields, respectively.

When this description file is processed, the generator will include the assigned ID information in the source pack.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29354319/194849405-e65f0ef9-482d-43ec-8e13-f78a137caec2.png)

## Empty packs

Empty packs Empty packets have no fields and are implemented as singletons. They are used as the most efficient way to signal something.


## Value pack

Packs with information that fits within 8 bytes are special - `Value` packs.
These packs do not allocate on the heap, and their data is stored in primitive types. 
The code generator provides methods for packing and unpacking the pack's field data.

Packs with a single primitive type field are `Value` packs by default.

## Enums and constants

Enums and constants If you need to propagate constants across hosts and they have the same integral type, use enums. 

The `[Flags]` attribute Indicates that an [enumeration can be treated as a bit field, or a set of flags.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.flagsattribute)

Non-initialized enum fields are automatically assigned integer values. If enum has the `[Flags]` attribute, the generated value,
 is a set of a **bit flags**


If your constants have a non-primitive data type, you can use static or const fields, either
-  within a pack that they are logically related to,
-  or within a constants set declared using a C# struct construction.

Enums and  `constants sets` are copied on every host and are never transfered.

The values of constants declared with `static` fields can be assigned as a number or as the result of a static expression.
You can use any available C# functions. Values are calculated during the code generaton time.

Constants declared with `const` fields can be used as `attributes parameters`. They have a value, but that value must be the result of a compile-time expression.
Due to language restrictions, standard static C# functions cannot be used to calculate the value.
To overcomes this limitation, the AdHoc protocol description syntax uses the `///<see cref="Pack.static_field_with_real_value"/>` construction.
At code generation time the system "copies" the value and type from a `static` -based constant  to a `const` -based constant.

                const string mm_h  = "mm/h";  // millimetres per hour

        interface CommunicationChannel : Communication_Channel_Of<Server.SendToClient, Client.SendToServer> { }
    }

</details>

The root description file's constants are propagated to all hosts.


## Importing other descriptions

The C# `using` statement in the description file header allows you to use entities declared in other protocol description files.

```csharp
using com.company.ProtocolProject;
using com.other_company.OtherProtocolProject;
```

Constants from imported, non-root files are only propagated if they are explicitly mentioned in the C# inheritance construction of the root project.
Inheritance from other projects propagates all **constants** that they have.
To propagate individual  items, inherit within the other projects use `enum`/`constants set`.

```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta;

namespace com.my.company
{
    public interface MyProject : Project_const_packs, Particular_const_pack {
        
    } 
}
```

This code propagates all **constants** from `Project_const_packs` and `Particular_const_pack` to all hosts in the `MyProject` project.

`Constants sets` can be wrapped to be used in C# code where only interfaces are allowed. Here is a real AdhocProtocol description file example:
```csharp
using org.unirail.Meta;

namespace org.unirail
{
    public interface AdhocProtocol : _<AdhocProtocol.Agent.Project.Host.Port.Pack.Field.DataType>//propagate DataType constants set to all hosts
    {
    }
}
```

# Fields

## `Optional` and `required` fields

A pack's field can be `optional` or `required`.

* `required` fields are always allocated and transmitted,even if they have not been modified or filled with data.
* `optional` fields, on the other hand, only allocate a few bits if they have not been modified.


According to the AdHoc protocol description rule, primitive data types that end with a `?` (such as `int?`, `byte?`, etc.) are 'optional', as are non-primitive data types such as `string` and `array`. For example:
```csharp
class Packet
{
    string user; //non-primitive data types are always optional
    uint? optional_field; //optional primitive field
}     
```


## Numeric type

All range of C# numeric primitive types are available

| Type   | Range                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| sbyte  | \-128 to 127                                             |
| byte   | 0 to 255                                                 |
| short  | \-32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| ushort | 0 to 65,535                                              |
| int    | \-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| uint   | 0 to 4,294,967,295                                       |
| long   | \-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| ulong  | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615                          |
| float  | ¬±1.5 x 10‚àí45 to ¬±3.4 x 1038                              |
| double | ¬±5.0 √ó 10‚àí324 to ¬±1.7 √ó 10308                            |

As the creator of a protocol, you likely have a better understanding of the scope of the data in advance than any code generator. 
**AdHoc** description provides attributes that allow you to share this knowledge with the generator, which helps to generate optimal code.

For example, if you know that the data for a particular field fits within a specific range, it is beneficial to declare it using the 'MinMax' attribute.  
The code generator will then try to find the best data type and generate range bound information to control the passing of values.

If value **range** is less than 127, the code generator will store the value in an internal bits storage to save space. For example:

```csharp
     [MinMax(1, 8)] int car_doors;     
```

for `car_doors` field code generator could allocate 3 bits in the bits storage.

If some field value is in range `200_005` to `200_078`,

```csharp
     [MinMax(200_005, 200_078)] int field;     
```
The code generator produces code that stores a field in the bits storage and provides getter/setter methods to add/subtract a constant value of  `200 005` constant.

## typedef

Typedef is used to create an additional name (alias) for another data type, but does not create a new type,
If you want some fields to share the same type - declare and use typedef.
By doing so, you can easily modify the data type of all related fields in one go.
Typedef is declare with C# class construction that hase only one field with the name typedef.
The type of this class is aliasing of the type of its `typedef` field.

For example:
By default, the `string` type in AdHoc protocol declares the string with a maximum length of 255 symbols.
To declare a field with different maximum symbols length, the `MaxSymbols` attribute can be used
```csharp
class Packet{
    string                      string_field_with_max_255_symbols;
    [MaxSymbols(6)] string      string_field_with_max_6_symbols;
    [MaxSymbols(7000)] string   string_field_with_max_7000_symbols;
}
```
But if you use these string types in many places, consider declaring the typedef: 
```csharp
class max_6_symbols_string{         //typedef
    [MaxSymbols(6)] string typedef;
}

class max_7000_symbols_string{      //typedef
    [MaxSymbols(7000)] string typedef;
}

class Packet{
    string                  string_field_with_max_255_symbols;
    max_6_symbols_string    string_field_with_max_6_symbols;      //using typedef
    max_7000_symbols_string string_field_with_max_7000_symbols;   //using typedef
}
```
you can redefine typedef
```csharp
class my_int_type{                  //typedef
    int typedef;
}
class max_3_symbols_string{         //typedef
    [MaxSymbols(3)] string typedef;
}
class Packet_redefine_my_int_type{
    [Dims(10)] max_3_symbols_string array_of_10_strings_field;  //redefine typedef
    [Dims(10)] my_int_type          array_of_10_ints_field;     //redefine typedef
    my_int_type                     int_field;                  //using typedef
    [X] my_int_type                 varint_int_field;           //redefine typedef
}
```

## Varint type

If a numeric field has random values uniformly distributed throughout the entire range of the numeric type, such as noise, it may look like the following visual representation:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29354319/70127303-bdf40900-16b5-11ea-94c9-c0dcd045500f.png)

Compressing this data type would be a waste of computing resources.  
However, if the numeric field has a particular dispersion or gradient pattern in its value range, as shown in the following image:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29354319/70128574-0a404880-16b8-11ea-8a4d-efa8a7358dc1.png)

Then it is possible to use this knowledge to minimize the amount of data transmission.  
In this case, the code generator can use [Base 128 Varint](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding)
compression
[algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity) on single fields and `Group Varint Encoding` on
array or lists, which reduces the amount of data being sent and optimizes resource load. 

This is achieved by skipping the transmission of higher bytes if they are zeros and then restoring them on the receiving end.

This graph shows the dependence of the number of bytes being sent on the transferred value.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29354319/70126207-84ba9980-16b3-11ea-9900-48251b545eef.png)

It is clear that `Varint Encoding`produces fewer bytes to transmit for smaller values.

There are three basic types of numeric value changing patterns:

|                                                     pattern                                                     | description                                                                                                                                                               |

```csharp
    [A]          uint?  field1;  //optional field, the data is compressable, the field can store values in the range from 0 to uint.MaxValue. 
    [MinMax(-1128, 873)]    byte  field2;   //required field, (without compression), the field accept values in range -1128 to -873                                                          
    [X]          short? field3;   //optional field takes values in the range  from -32 768 to 32 767. will be compressed with ZigZag algorithm.                                       
    [A(1000)]     short field4;   //required field takes a value between ‚Äì 1 000 to 65 535 will be compressed on sending.                                                           
    [V]          short? field5;   //optional field takes a value between  -65 535  to 0  will be compressed on sending.                                                                 
    [MinMax(-11 , 75)] short field6;   //required field with uniformly distributed values in the specified range.     
                                                                                
```


## String type

In the **AdHoc protocol**, strings in all languages are encoded as UTF-8 byte arrays. . Additionally, all string fields are `optional`

```csharp
string  string_field;
```
By default, the `string` type in AdHoc protocol declares the string with a maximum length of 255 symbols.

To declare a field with different maximum symbols length, the `MaxSymbols` attribute can be used
```csharp
class Packet{
    string                      string_field_with_max_255_symbols;
    [MaxSymbols(6)] string      string_field_with_max_6_symbols;
    [MaxSymbols(7000)] string   string_field_with_max_7000_symbols;
}
```
But if you use these string types in many places, consider declaring the typedef:
```csharp
class max_6_symbols_string{         //typedef
    [MaxSymbols(6)] string typedef;
}

class max_7000_symbols_string{      //typedef
    [MaxSymbols(7000)] string typedef;
}

class Packet{
    string                  string_field_with_max_255_symbols;
    max_6_symbols_string    string_field_with_max_6_symbols;      //using typedef
    max_7000_symbols_string string_field_with_max_7000_symbols;   //using typedef
}
```

## Multidimensional fields

The field in question can hold a multidimensional array of various types, including primitives, strings, maps, sets, and packs.
These dimensions can be of either a constant or variable length.

`[Dims]` attribute is used to declare multidimensional field: `Dims(N, -N, N)]`

| N  |N is length of constant dimension         |
|----| :-------------------------------------------|
| -N | N is maximum length of variable dimension  |

## Multidimensional array of arrays

A multidimensional array can also contain other arrays, where the last dimension (or argument) of the `Dims` attribute indicates the parameter of the contained array.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>~N</td>
      <td>All contained arrays have the same variable length, N is it maximum, Exact length is determined at field creation
and cannot be changed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>~~N</td>
      <td>Each contained array has its own length, N is a maximum length. Can be changed individually </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+N</td>
      <td>All arrays, if created, are have the same constant length - N.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
The lengths of the variable dimensions are set during field initialization.

```cs
        class Pack {
            [Dims(2 , 3 , 4)] short field1; // multidimensional field of primitive with constant dimensions 

            [Dims(2, -3, -4)] Point field2; //field with multidimensional array of  Ponts. dimension 1 can be in rande 1..3. dimension 2 - in range 1..4 
            
            [Dims(2, -3, +4)] Pack array_field; //field with multidimensional array of constant length 4, arrays of Packs 
            
            [Dims(~17)] Pack var_len_array; //field with var length array of Packs, with max length 17 

            [Dims(2, -3, ~~4)] string array_field1; //multidimensional array of arays of strings. each array has its own length
        }
```
## Fields with binary array datatype

You can declare a field with a binary data type by using the special attribute `org.unirail.Binary`. The content of this type is transferred directly.
However, the implementation of this field type may depend on the target platform. For example, in Java, it is represented by a signed `byte`, whereas in C#, it is represented by an unsigned 'byte'


## Fields with Map/Set datatype

The description of fields with a Map/Set datatype is simple and straightforward. 

```csharp
            Set<uint>                 uint_set;
            Set<float?>               uint_set;
            Set<City>                 set_of_City_types;
            [MinMax(4, 45)] Set<uint> set_with_MinMax_attributes;

            Map<string, byte?>                            string_2_byte;
            [V]                        Map<uint?, ulong?> only_key_attribute_map;
            [MapValueParams, Dims(-5)] Map<uint, uint>    only_value_attribute_map;
            [V, MapValueParams, V]     Map<uint?, ulong?> map_with_key_value_attibutes;
```
`MapValueParams` attribute is `Key`-`Value` attributes delimiter. Attributes after this delimiter apply to `value` type.


## Fields with other pack/enum as datatype

Enums and pack can be a field's data type.

Packs can have nested data types and self-referential fields in their fields' data type.
However, empty packs or enums with fewer than two fields cannot be used as a field data type. In such cases, a boolean type should be used instead if only a single binary value is required. 
It's important to note that different programming languages may have their own rules regarding data types, so it's essential to refer to the language documentation for specific details.
